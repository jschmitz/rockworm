The nine lies create a quick read and there are several concepts that I identified with based on my experiences:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Local teams matter most</li>
  <li>Cascading goals is challenging</li>
  <li>People need positive feedback</li>
  <li>Play to peoples strengths</li>
</ol>

<p>A chapter that stood out to action on and apply is <em>The Best Plan Wins</em>. The story of Operation and Intelligence (O &amp; I) two hour meeting is fascinating for someone who generally avoids frequent meetings and with many people. I’m interested to apply this concept in a yet to be determined form.</p>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>The best plan wins</td>
      <td>The best intelligence wins. Share as much information as possible. Determine what data is most useful. Trust people to use the data. Reverse the normal paradigm. Leaders provide information and people use that information to make decisions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>The best companies cascade goals</td>
      <td>The best companies cascade meaning. Work is ahead of you, goals are behind you. Work is specific and detailed; goals are abstract. Work changes fast; goals change slowly or not at all. Work makes you feel like you have agency; goals make you feel like a cog in a machine. Work makes you feel trusted; goals make you fell distrusted. Work is work; goals aren’t.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>The best people are well rounded</td>
      <td>Messi uses his left foot in a 10:1 ratio. Focus on strengths; activities that make you feel good / find joy in. The successes you find will create positive feedback loop for and you’ll develop a deep skill.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>People need feedback</td>
      <td>People need attention. Frequency is more important than quality of one on ones. Positive attention is 30 times more motivating than negative attention. Positive future focused attention gives your brain access to more regions of itself and thus sets you up for greater learning.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>People can reliably rate other people</td>
      <td>Talent and performance reviews are challenging. Generally, bad data is generated. There are approaches to create questions that can be answered in ways to create better / good data.</td>

      <td>All people have potential. People have a current momentum. How can momentum be used to level up skills?</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Work Life balance matters most</td>
      <td>The dichotomy that work hours will be ‘survived’ and not work hours are enjoyed is false. Finding what you enjoy in your work is most important. Many people have the opportunity to find what they enjoy and do not take advantage of that opportunity. Take the initiative to find what you enjoy and create an environment that enables you to thrive. As a manager, helping folks find their niche or passions is highly rewarding.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Leadership is a thing</td>
      <td>Leaders have many different traits. A commonality across leaders is that they have expertise in trait / skill and people will follow a person with an expertise.</td>
