<p>I had to go back and think about why these? I hadn’t thought about it too much previously so how did this just roll out pretty quickly?</p>

<p>Upon a bit of reflection, these are the most impactful and useful books when I look back. I’ve take concepts from each, applied and have had positive outcomes. Below is a brief description for each to see if you might want to check it out.</p>

<table>

      <td>This negotiation book is not at all what I expected in a good way. Negotiation is great collaboration. Most people need to collaborate to be successful this read has approaches and tactics that are useful for you day to day. This may be #2 on my list but this may be where more of my focus will go.</td>

It’s also fun to become aware of and identify successful approaches that and see if they may work for you too.
