          The proof of concept side projects I've worked on during quarentine have been created using <a href="www.freeclimb.com">FreeClimb</a>. The apps were fun to build and if other folks found them useful, directly or checking out the code to build something else, thats great. The apps using FreeClimb out on Github are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/jschmitz/rockworm">Data Collector</a></li>
          <li><a href="">Shop Safe</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/jschmitz/kms_conferencing">Simple Conferencing</a></li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The first POC app worked on was a direct dial conferencing app with the thought more folks might want to make simple conference calls. The app had a text based sharing mechanism.  The app didn't spreadlike wildfire and I use it mainly for testing now. The second app, Shop Safe, was a hack day app. I had a really enjoyable day working with a few other folks and the concept might be useful for communicating in our pick up / shopping scenarios. The third app is a data collection app, right now it calls me everyday to see if I exercised. I love stats but really dislike entering data, the phone call is useful and this project plan to extend the application.

            The idea the small things you do with discipline on a daily basis appeal to me. Looking back, I can see the impacts of habits for big efforts in my life in academics, running and athletics and my career and its really interesting to view that those daily activities have driven the outcomes I've had good outcomes when my day to day habits were good and when my habits slipped my outcomes weren't as good. The books that have help to get me there are, in the order of readhing, are 7 Habits of Hightly Effiective People, Slight Edge, Power of Habit and the best of the bunch Atomic Habits. Atomic Habits had the biggest impact and is helping my continue to build better habits and wortha second read. If you were to pick one book to read Atomic Habits would be my choice.
          </p>

            On of the my exploration projects is to collect more data. I've started with my exercise routine and collecting information there. Check out the heatmap of what I've been up to lately. I've discovered as I age that I need more Yoga and Pilates and rest vs. running and jumping and heavy weights. Building the calendar heatmap you see was a lot of fun (ties back to Atomic Habits!) and making sure my green squares are trending in a good direction.
